<section class="section1">
<p>Mardi Gras In French it means Fat Tuesday, a holiday that has its origins in the Christian tradition, celebrated in many Christian communities around the world, as part of the carnival celebrations. For example, in the city of New Orleans in the United States, where the holiday has been celebrated for about 250 years, and has become one of the city's most representative cultural events.
    The holiday was brought to New Orleans by the French Catholic founders as a religious holiday. The holiday soon became a non-religious cultural feature, and is celebrated mainly in the tourist area of ​​the French Quarter in the city. During the holiday, the streets of New Orleans are filled for about two weeks with unstoppable celebrations of dances, marches and intoxication of the senses, in particularly colorful costumes and clothing, and sometimes in the partial attire of the participants in the festival.</p>

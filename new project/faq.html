<h2 class="question">1: Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.</p>

<h2 class="question">2: When does Mardi Gras start and end?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.
    Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.
    Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.</p>

<h2 class="question">3: What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.
    Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!</p>

<h2 class="question">4: Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a balcony, food and a bathroom pass.</p>

<h2 class="question">5: Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade, because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads and more.
    The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon, since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.</p>

<h2 class="question">6: What are the best ways to get around New Orleans once I've arrived?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">The best methods of transportation will be via taxi/ride-sharing services, streetcar or rental car depending on where you're staying. Driving your own car and finding parking spots will be difficult.</p>

<h2 class="question">7: Why does Mardi Gras fall on different dates each year?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">The date of Mardi Gras changes every year because it's connected to Easter, which can fall on any Sunday between March 23 and April 25. Mardi Gras day always takes place 47 days before Easter.
    When is Mardi Gras?</p>

<h2 class="question">8: How can I find out what this year's Mardi Gras theme will be?<i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-down"></i></h2>
<p class="answer">
    There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no single organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes were popular.
    Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are named after the neighborhood where they parade.</p>
